* TODO Introduction
** TODO Description of Project :ignore:
** TODO Why is this worth looking into?
*** TODO Look into Baltimore crime statistics
*** TODO Tie into police officers
* TODO Data Collection
** TODO Static Data
This is data that is stored within the repository and does not get downloaded/computed by the code.
** TODO Dynamic Data
This is data that is /not/ stored within the repository and /does/ get downloaded/computed by the code.
* TODO Data Processing
This is when we clean and normalize our data, preparing it for interpretation and analysis.
* TODO Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization
This is where we will see what our data is telling us, so that we can make better judgements on what to look at for interpretation.
* TODO Interpretation/Conclusion
This is where we will draw conclusions from our data.
* File Config :noexport:
This is some Emacs configuration I have autoload when I open my notebook file.
~org-babel-clean-autoexport-mode~ is a minor mode in my configuration which
automatically saves dirty notebooks to the file specified in
~CLEAN-EXPORT-FILENAME~, removing any ~:RESULTS:~ in the output.  This has the
effect of making the document easily version-controllable, since the variable
outputs of each code block do not mess with the ~diff~.

Local Variables:
eval: (org-babel-clean-autoexport-mode)
