#+title: Baltimore Crime Analysis

The project focuses on analyzing Baltimore crime data to identify major factors contributing to crime rates and their geographic distribution.
The goal is to gain insights into the underlying causes of crime in order to address them effectively and reduce crime rates.

* Introduction
The project aims to understand the reasons behind the high crime rates in Baltimore, one of the most populous and dangerous cities in Maryland.
By analyzing existing crime data and exploring various factors that may influence crime, the project seeks to draw correlations and provide valuable insights that can help in reducing crime in the future.

* Project Objectives
- Analyze Baltimore crime data to identify major factors contributing to crime rates.
- Investigate the relationship between crime and geographic features such as population density, median income, proximity to police stations, bars, liquor stores, and vacant buildings.
- Provide actionable insights to help law enforcement agencies allocate resources effectively and make informed decisions to combat crime.

* Datasets
The project uses the Baltimore Crime Data dataset, published by the city of Baltimore itself.
The dataset contains information about various crimes, including their locations and crime codes.
Additionally, other datasets such as population density, median household income, and location data for police stations, liquor stores, bars, and vacant buildings are utilized to explore potential correlations with crime.
* Methodology
The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Collection:
   - Retrieve Baltimore Community Statistical Areas and their
     boundaries.
   - Download and preprocess the Baltimore Crime Data.
   - Gather additional datasets related to population density, median
     income, police stations, liquor stores, bars, and vacant buildings.
2. Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization:
   - Conduct exploratory analysis on the crime data.
   - Visualize crime patterns, median income distribution, population
     density, and other relevant factors.
   - Identify regions with the highest crime rates and low median
     income.
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Extract relevant features from the datasets, including crime codes,
     proximity to police stations, bars, liquor stores, and vacant
     buildings.
   - Perform data transformations, normalization, and filtering as
     needed.
4. Correlation Analysis:
   - Analyze the correlation between different factors and crime rates.
   - Determine statistically significant relationships and their impact
     on crime.
5. Crime Hotspot Identification:
   - Utilize K-Means clustering to identify crime hotspots based on
     geographic features.
   - Evaluate clustering results and visualize crime clusters on a map.
6. Conclusion:
   - Summarize the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.
   - Provide recommendations for law enforcement agencies and
     policymakers based on the results.
